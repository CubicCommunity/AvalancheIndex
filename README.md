### Badges
###### The members of Avalanche.

When viewing a profile or comment, you'll likely see a badge next to their name. This means they form part of, or are associated with, Avalanche in some way. These are the badges that you may see appear next the name of such person.

| **Icon**                                                                       | **Role**             |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|----------------------|

### Levels
###### The Avalanche team projects.
When viewing level cells or pages, you may notice the background color changes. The level is published by a team member and it can be either a solo or a collaboration they hosted independently. Here are the colors you may find highlighting such.

<b><span style="background-color: rgb(66, 94, 255);">This is a team project!</span></b>     
<b><span style="background-color: rgb(70, 77, 117);">This is a team member's solo level!</span></b>

Unlisted or unrated levels will not be highlighted.
