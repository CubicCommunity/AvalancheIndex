### Badges
###### The members of Avalanche.
When viewing someone's profile or comment, you'll likely see a badge next to their name. This means they form part of, or are associated with, Avalanche in some way. These are the badges that you may see appear next the name of said person. The text color of members' comments will also change depending on their role in the team, unless they are the publisher of the level.

- ![icon](cubicstudios.avalancheindex/director.png) Director
- ![icon](cubicstudios.avalancheindex/team-manager.png) Team Manager
- ![icon](cubicstudios.avalancheindex/team-member.png) Team Member
- ![icon](cubicstudios.avalancheindex/collaborator.png) Collaborator
- ![icon](cubicstudios.avalancheindex/cubic-studios.png) **Cubic Studios** Staff

You can also press the icon of the badge itself in-game to get more information about the role itself.

### Levels
###### The Avalanche team projects.
When viewing level cells or pages, you may notice the changes in the background color. The level is either a team project on Avalanche's publisher account, or a solo or a collaboration hosted and published independently by a team member. These are the colors you may find highlighting such. The title font for team projects will also change.

- **<cj>Azure Blue</c> `#425EFF`** - Team project
- **<cl>Slate Blue</c> `#464D75`** - Solo level

Unlisted or unrated levels will not be highlighted.

<cr>*Level highlights might not be displayed until the profile or a comment of the creator is viewed beforehand.*</c>

### Featured
###### The up-and-coming Avalanche project.
In the main menu, you may see a button in the center that, when pressed, will show you a pop-up showing the latest Avalanche team project.
