## About
The *Avalanche Index* mod fetches and processes data from an external repository to highlight players and levels that are official to Avalanche. This mod is meant to be utilized as a tool by the Geometry Dash players in Avalanche's community to better discern between official and otherwise misleading and unofficial users and levels.

### Badges
###### The members of Avalanche.
When viewing someone's profile or comment, you'll likely see a badge next to their name. This means they form part of, or are associated with, Avalanche in some way. These are the badges that you may see appear next the name of said person. The text color of members' comments will also change depending on their role in the team, unless they are the publisher of the level.

### Levels
###### The Avalanche team projects.
When viewing level cells or pages, you may notice the changes in the background color. The level is either a team project on Avalanche's publisher account, or a solo or a collaboration hosted and published independently by a team member. These are the colors you may find highlighting such. The title font for team projects will also change.

- **<cj>Azure Blue</c> `#425EFF`** - Team project
- **<cl>Slate Blue</c> `#464D75`** - Solo level
- **<cy>Acid Yellow</c> `#D3CF00`** - Event level

Level cells with a glow emerging from the side represent levels in Avalanche's hall of fame. These levels stand out the most among the team's creations. By default, unrated or unlisted levels will not be highlighted.

If a level is featured on Avalanche's servers, you may see a button with the Avalanche logo appear on the left side menu on the level's information page. Pressing this will create a pop-up giving more information about the level as a project by the team, the type of project it is, its host, etc. You will also see a button to watch its full showcase video.
